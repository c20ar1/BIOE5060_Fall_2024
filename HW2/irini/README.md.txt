I modified the following parts of the desktop:

Panel
Under panel preferences, I modified the settings so that the panel automatically hides intelligently, changed the panel color, added several items to the panel (action button, weather update, changed the appearance of the clock, battery percentage) and changed the order of the items on the panel.

Wallpaper
I uploaded a wallpaper found online to customize the background. The wallpaper has a CC BY-SA (Creative Commons) license which "enables reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, so long as attribution is given to the creator."

System Fonts/Theme/Styles
In the Settings Manager, I changed the system theme to Greybird-dark and changed the system font to Noto Sans Adlam.

Windows border themes/styles, transparency
I added a shade button to the layout at the top of each window. I changed the terminal background to be transparent and set the terminal font to system font.

Icon Sets
I modified the icons so that they are high contrast theme, made the icons a little bit smaller in size, changed the icon orientation to be top left horizontal, and changed a setting so that items/icons are activated with a single click.
