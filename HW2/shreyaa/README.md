Shreyaa Parvath Rajkumar Homework 2 

To customize my desktop I did the following changes:
1. Changed the background/wallpaper.
2. Downloaded the Gnome-Tweaks tool to help change settings like fonts, and appearances. The gnome-tweaks tool was installed by running <sudo apt install gnome-tweaks>. It is an open source software and is reusable, modifiable under the GNU General Public License as pubslished by the Free software foundation.
3. Installed new fonts and changed the system font settings.
4. Modified dock layout and location.
5. Modified folder icons to a color that matches background theme.
6. Installed and added To-do and Weather apps on the desktop using the Flatpak open source framework. It was installed by running <sudo apt install flatpak>. The Flatpakl tool is also open source and is licensed under the Creatives Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
