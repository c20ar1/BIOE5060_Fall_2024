1. Changed the orientation of the panels to the right of the screen and 
make it smaller  using the setting in the linux desktop. 
2. I downloaded a photo of a field of flowers from google and applied it 
as the wallpaper through the desktop settings https://10best.usatoday.com/interests/explore/10-pretty-flower-fields-world/
3. Downloaded font from fonts.google.com and applied it which can be seen 
in the terminal text that is opened on the top of the screen https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat
4. Changed the icon set which I downloaded from gnome-look (https://www.pling.com/p/1279924/) but when I went to upload to reflect in the files it did not show up but I was able to find the same icon set that I originally downloaded in the systems software repository, not sure if that is because I downloaded it or because that is a default option to switch to but this can be seen in the files
5. Changed the theme color to purple which can be seen in the color of the folders. This was done on the systems direct settings. 
6. Changed the mouse to be a glass transparency but could not be included 
in the screen shot. 
7. Deleted unnecessary files from the panel.
